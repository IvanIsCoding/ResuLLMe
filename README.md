## üöÄ Concept

ResuLLMe is a prototype that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to tailor r√©sum√©s. It's goal is to enhance r√©sum√©s to help candidates avoid common mistakes that occur while applying for jobs. It is like a smart career advisor to check your r√©sum√©.

You can use ResuLLMe live at [https://resullme.streamlit.app/](https://resullme.streamlit.app/).

## üõ† How It Works

ResuLLMe receives your previous CV as a PDF or Word Document. Then, it uses LLMs to:
* Improve the r√©sum√© following published r√©sum√© guidelines by well-reputed schools
* Convert the r√©sum√©s to a JSON Resume format
* Render the JSON resume using LaTeX to generate a new PDF of the enhanced resume

### üê≥ Docker installation For Linux

To install Docker on Linux, follow the instructions on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

To install Docker Compose, run the following command:

```bash
apt install docker-compose
```


## üèÉ Running

To run ResuLLMe locally, the simplest way is to use Docker:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will make the app avaialable at [`https://localhost:8501/`](https://localhost:8501/)

### ü™Ñ Installation Instructions for Running Natively

To run the app without Docker, you will need to install two things for the app to work. The first item is to install the Python dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The second item is to install the LaTeX packages:

```
xargs sudo apt install -y < packages.txt
```

Lastly, to run ResuLLMe locally, execute:

```
streamlit run src/Main.py
```

## ü§≤ Contributing

ResuLLMe is an open source project.

If you want to contribute, open a [Pull requests](https://github.com/360macky/project-name/pulls). 
All contributions are welcome, but some that would particularly be useful to the community are:
* Fixes in existing LaTeX templates
* Adding new LaTeX templates
* Improved prompts
* Support for other LLMs (e.g. Bard, Claude, LLaMA)
