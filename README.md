üëâ Check some sample r√©sum√©s generated by ResuLLMe ([1](./.github/samples/Simple.pdf), [2](./.github/samples/Alta.pdf), [3](./.github/samples/Awesome.pdf))

## üöÄ Concept

ResuLLMe is a prototype that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to tailor r√©sum√©s. It's goal is to enhance r√©sum√©s to help candidates avoid common mistakes that occur while applying for jobs. It is like a smart career advisor to check your r√©sum√©.

You can use ResuLLMe live at [https://resullme.streamlit.app/](https://resullme.streamlit.app/).

## üõ† How It Works
ResuLLMe now supports both OpenAI and Gemini, empowering the application to enhance r√©sum√©s with even more powerful and diverse language models, providing users with smarter, more accurate career guidance.  

ResuLLMe accepts multiple input sources:
* Upload your existing CV as a PDF or Word Document
* Provide your LinkedIn profile URL for scraping
* Use both your r√©sum√© and LinkedIn profile for a more comprehensive result

Then, it uses LLMs to:
* Improve the r√©sum√© following published r√©sum√© guidelines by well-reputed schools
* Convert the r√©sum√©s to a JSON Resume format
* Render the JSON resume using LaTeX to generate a new PDF of the enhanced resume

### üîé LinkedIn Profile Scraping

The LinkedIn profile scraping feature allows you to use your public LinkedIn profile as input instead of or alongside your traditional r√©sum√©. This is particularly useful when:
* You don't have an up-to-date r√©sum√© but maintain your LinkedIn profile
* You want to enhance your r√©sum√© with additional information from your LinkedIn profile
* You're experimenting with different formats and want to compare outputs

The scraper works with public LinkedIn profiles and extracts information such as:
* Professional experience
* Education history
* Skills and endorsements
* About section and other relevant profile content

## üèÉ Running

To run ResuLLMe locally, the simplest way is to use Docker:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will make the app avaialable at [`https://localhost:8501/`](https://localhost:8501/)

### ü™Ñ Installation Instructions for Running Natively

To run the app without Docker, you will need to install two things for the app to work. The first item is to install the Python dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The second item is to install the LaTeX packages and other system dependencies:

```
xargs sudo apt install -y < packages.txt
```

For the LinkedIn scraping feature, you'll need to install:
* Chrome or Chromium browser
* wkhtmltopdf

On Ubuntu/Debian:
```
sudo apt install -y wkhtmltopdf chromium-browser
```

On macOS:
```
brew install wkhtmltopdf chromium
```

Lastly, to run ResuLLMe locally, execute:

```
streamlit run src/Main.py
```

## ü§≤ Contributing

ResuLLMe is an open source project.

If you want to contribute, open a [Pull requests](https://github.com/360macky/project-name/pulls). 
All contributions are welcome, but some that would particularly be useful to the community are:
* Fixes in existing LaTeX templates
* Adding new LaTeX templates
* Improved prompts
* Support for other LLMs (e.g. Bard, Claude, LLaMA)
* Enhanced web scraping for additional data sources
