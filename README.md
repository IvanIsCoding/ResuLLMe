## üöÄ Concept

ResuLLMe is a prototype that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to tailor r√©sum√©s. It's goal is to enhance r√©sum√©s to help candidates avoid common mistakes that occur while applying for jobs. It is like a smart career advisor to check your r√©sum√©.

You can use ResuLLMe live at [https://resullme.streamlit.app/](https://resullme.streamlit.app/).

## üõ† How It Works

ResuLLMe receives your previous CV as a PDF or Word Document. Then, it uses LLMs to:
* Improve the r√©sum√© following published r√©sum√© guidelines by well-reputed schools
* Convert the r√©sum√©s to a JSON Resume format
* Render the JSON resume using LaTeX to generate a new PDF of the enhanced resume

## üèÉ Running

To run ResuLLMe locally,  execute:

```
streamlit run src/Main.py
```

### ü™Ñ Installation Instructions

Notice that you will need to install two things for the app to work. The first are the Python dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The second is the LaTeX packages:

```
sudo apt install -y < packages.txt
```
