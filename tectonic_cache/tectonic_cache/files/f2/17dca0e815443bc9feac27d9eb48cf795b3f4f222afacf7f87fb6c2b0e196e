% ==========================================
% This file contains hyphenation patterns for Norwegian Nynorsk.
% It uses the Norwegian hyphenation patterns from hyph-no.tex,
% created by Rune Kleveland and Ole Michael Selberg. Please see
% that file for copyright information on those patterns.
%
% The patterns in hyph-no.tex are based on both Norwegian Bokm√•l
% and Norwegian Nynorsk, and works about equally well for both
% languages. This file, hyph-nn.tex, contains only a few hyphenation
% exceptions, for words that needs to be hyphenated differently for
% the two languages.
%
% Please send bugs or suggestions to karl@huftis.org.
