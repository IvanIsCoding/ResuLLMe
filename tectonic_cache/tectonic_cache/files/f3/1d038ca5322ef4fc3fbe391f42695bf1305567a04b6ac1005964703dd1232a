%
% This configuration file sets up TeX Ligatures by default for all fonts loaded
% with `\setmainfont` and `\setsansfont`.
%
% In addition, `\setmonofont` has default features to enforce "monospace"
% settings with regard to space stretchability and shrinkability.

% Make a copy of this file in your own home TEXMF directory to set up your own
% defaults.
